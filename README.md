3 qualities you should be looking for in leaders:

1. Integrity
2. Intelligence
3. Energy

Hiring someone with integrity and intelligence but not energy will make your business money but not as much as if they also had energy.

Hiring someone with integrity and energy but not intelligence won't make any money for your business.

Hiring someone with intelligence and energy but not integrity will make your business lose money.

Code readability is more important than code writability, since in the long-term your code will be read a lot more 
than it will be modified. Ideal of course if the code is both easy to read and modify but if you have to choose 
lean towards readability.

As a businessman you focus, as an investor you diversify.

Similar to how what you eat composes your body, what you read composes your mind.

Every book can be broken into the following "nutrients":

- Proteins: useful life hacks, tools, methods, rules (you need to use and apply it in your life)
- Carbohydrates: gives you energy, motivates, surprises, inspires (you should think about it often)
- Fats: interesting stories, intriguing, pleasurable, fictional parts (you can leave it in the book)
- Fibre: references, numbers, dates, facts, tables, statistics (it's important but you don't need to remember it)
- Vitamins: anecdotes, jokes, funny stories, beautiful quotes (makes you an interesting companion)
- Water: everything else (you can forget it)
