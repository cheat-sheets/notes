3 qualities you should be looking for in leaders:

1. Integrity
2. Intelligence
3. Energy

Hiring someone with integrity and intelligence but not energy will make your business money but not as much as if they also had energy.

Hiring someone with integrity and energy but not intelligence won't make any money for your business.

Hiring someone with intelligence and energy but not integrity will make your business lose money.

Code readability is more important than code writability, since in the long-term your code will be read a lot more 
than it will be modified. Ideal of course if the code is both easy to read and modify but if you have to choose 
lean towards readability.
